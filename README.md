[![RaiMan's Stuff](https://raw.github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014-Docs/master/src/main/resources/docs/source/RaiManStuff64.png)](http://www.sikuli.org) SikuliX 1.1.5
============

 **Be aware**
This version is a developement version and currently only available as a fork of this repo
 
Main intention is, to make the the base for image/text searching and OCR more general:

- Image should be an extension of a Region with the same features 
(except that it is not bound to a screen, but to some image content and you cannot click or type on it)

Another intention: make a first step into recording and image handling

**You need at least Java 8, but it works on Java 9, 10, 11 also** (recommended: 11)

**Developement is done on Java 11 (OpenJDK release)**

<hr>

**Works out of the box for Mac and Windows**

**For Linux** you have to make the prerequisites OpenCV and Tesseract ready ([for HowTo look here](https://sikulix-2014.readthedocs.io/en/latest/newslinux.html#version-1-1-4-special-for-linux-people))
